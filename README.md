# Where have earthquakes occurred in the last 7 days?

 ### **Overview**
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) provides scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change.

This visualisation used leaflet to show earthquakes that occured in the last seven days from [USGS data](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)

### **Aspects covered**
 - Using D3 to connect to a geojson API
 - Changing the marker size shown on the map based on earthquake magnitude
 - Adding tooltips containing additional information
 - Including a colour coded legend on the map that corresponds to earthquake depth
